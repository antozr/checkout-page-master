<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

## The structure 

For create the structure , I have use the container tag in html, for structure in two blocks  one for the items / price component and the second for the form component. With the flex I modify the position in mobile or pc device. 

## The form

For this I have used the basic tag in html for create this and I used the required element in input tag for obliged user to write in input. 

## The js 

For the items/prices js, I am used the getElementById for shearch the buton + & - for incremant the numbers of this and the number is write with the innerHTML.  To final price for all items, I have used a basic math formul.

For the form, I have used the localStorage for store deferently information of this and used a count for verrify the  content after send this at the server.
